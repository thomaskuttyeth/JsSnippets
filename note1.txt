/*
js is a highlevel, prototype-based object-oriented, multi-paradigm, interpreted or just-in-time compiled, dynamic,single-threaded, garbase-collected programming language with first-class functions and a non-blocking event loop concurrency model. 

*/


// procedural programming 
// object -oriented programming 
// functional programming 
// functions are simply treated as variables. we can pass them into other functions, and return them from functions. 
// dynamically typing : data type of variable is automatically changed, no data type definition. types becomes known at runtime. 

// concurrency model : how the js engie handles multiple tasks happening at the same time. 
// js runs in one single thread. so it can only do one thing at a time. 
// js engine : program that executes javascript code : v8 engine of chrome. 
// compilation : entire code is converted into macine code at once, and written to a binary file that can be excecuted by a computer. 
// interpretation: interpreter runs through the source code and executed it line by line 

// just-in-compilatoin : entire code is converted into machine code at once , then excecuted immediately. 
// modern javascript just-in-time compilation : 
// source code --> parsing(ast) --> compilatio -->> execution --> optimization --> compilation --> execution : 

// call stack and heap 
// web apis (DOM, Timers, Fetch api ...)
